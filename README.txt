[Background]
	A college C++ final project done for my C++ class.

[Description]
	* Very old-fashioned hangman game played on the command prompt with no images, like the days of DOS
	* Three options: Start Game, Load File, Exit
	  - Start Game, starts the game
	  - Load File allows users to import their own word list from a text file. Words must be separated by a new line. 
	    Words with numbers and/or special characters have those characters stripped.
	  - Exit closes the game
	* Three difficulties: 
	  - EASY = 12 guesses
	  - NORMAL = 6 guesses
	  - HARD = 6 guesses but with every incorrect guess, the current guessing word will change to a different word in the list
	* After the end of every game, the user will be returned to the main menu.
	* A lot of error checking, from checking valid inputs to stripping special characters and numbers from words in a word list.
